Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control
Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet.
You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your
projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

This example shows how to initialize your ESP8266/ESP32 board
and connect it to Blynk.

Don't forget to change WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS and BLYNK_AUTH ;)

def runLoop():
    while True:
        blynk.run()
        machine.idle()

# Run blynk in the main thread:
runLoop()

# Or, run blynk in a separate thread (unavailable for esp8266):
#import _thread
#_thread.stack_size(5*1024)
#_thread.start_new_thread(runLoop, ())


# Note:
# Threads are currently unavailable on some devices like esp8266
# ESP32_psRAM_LoBo has a bit different thread API:
# _thread.start_new_thread("Blynk", runLoop, ())
